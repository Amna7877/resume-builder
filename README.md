# 📄 Resume Builder — SMIT Hackathon Project

A modern, responsive **Resume Builder Web Application** built using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**.  
This project was developed during the **Saylani Mass I.T Training (SMIT) Hackathon**, where the focus was to build a functional and clean frontend application within a **short, time-bound environment**.

The goal of this project was not only to design a resume builder UI, but also to **test confidence, speed, and problem-solving skills under pressure**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This Resume Builder allows users to:
- Enter resume information using form inputs
- View changes **instantly** through live preview
- Experience a clean, modern UI with **dark/light mode**
- Understand how real-world frontend applications manage state and UI updates

The project emphasizes **component-based architecture**, reusable UI, and responsive design.

## 🎯 Hackathon Context

This project was created during the **SMIT Hackathon**, where I worked under:
- Strict time constraints  
- Live evaluation and viva  
- Real development pressure  

Completing this project within the given time helped me gain confidence in:
- Writing React code faster
- Structuring components efficiently
- Presenting my work clearly

My project was also **appreciated by my instructor**, which further motivated me and validated my learning progress.

The app follows a modular component structure so each part of the UI can be reused or extended easily.
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
User inputs data into form fields

Data is stored using React useState

As state updates, the Resume Preview updates instantly

Theme state controls dark/light UI using Tailwind classes

React handles efficient re-rendering via Virtual DOM
